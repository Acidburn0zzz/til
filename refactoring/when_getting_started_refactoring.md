# When do we get started refactoring?
__Simple question goes with a simple answer__
* Smell something wrong: This is the best solution I know but I couldn't go with since I will break something
* Hard to implement the new: It becomes harder to implement/add new things

__Coding is all about think, write it down, then rewrite it in a better way__ (in performance, code structure, or logic,...)
* Write it fast to capture your idea
* Keep in mind, I will pay for this shit, refactor it

__Sometimes, the business requires us go quickly, then we forget to pay our debts__
* Always remember this: _Permit today, pay tomorrow_, going fast with a wrong foundation will get failed soon.
* Fast means optimizing, not building tons of bullshit in a short time.
* Plan it, make a process that includes refactoring.
