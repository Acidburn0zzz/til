# What is wrong with MVP
* MVP is not: _Do as little as possible_ but _build in order to validate an approach to solving X_
* MVP is not: _Release what we need to release_ but _It just a start, it may take some iterations to nail what is meaningful for users_

__MVP is not MLP (Minimum Lovable Production) or MMP (Minimum Marketable Product)__, but is the tool to help us _create meaningful products_
