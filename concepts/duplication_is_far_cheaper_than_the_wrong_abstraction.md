# __Duplication__ is far cheaper than the __wrong abstraction__
We still remember why in the first day, we were taught about *DRY* (Don't repeat yourself). Because at that time, we didn't understand anything else.

Deepen our understanding about pattern & design to make everything simple, somehow __duplication__ will be cheaper than the premature __abstraction__
