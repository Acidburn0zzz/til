# SOLID principles of OO and Agile design

* Srp: The Single Responsibily principle
Don't mix concerns in your classes

* Ocp: The Open/Closed principle
Modules should be open for extension, but closed for modification -- Bertrand Meyer
Adding a new code without changing the old ones
The high level policy doesn't know about the low level details

* Lsp: The Liskov Subsitution principle
Derived classed must be usable through the base class interface, without the need for the user to know the difference
The things that represent don't share the relationship of the things that represent
The inheritance is an is-a relationship, it isn't actually the redecoration of function and variables in the subcode

* Isp: The Interface Segregation principle

* Dip: The Dependency Inversion principle
