# Remove unknown code
When we see the unknown code, in the first glance, your question will be *Should I remove it?*
* Yes. When you remove it but your tests were rerun and passed. Just make sure your tests is __sufficient__. But no one knows *What does __sufficent__ mean?* You are graceful to continue?
* No. You will stay with it forever

In summary, for the code you don't know, remove it as soon as possible, the longer you stay with it, the more risky you have!

__REMOVE IT ANYWAY__
